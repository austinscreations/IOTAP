kicad files
=====================

These kicad files are of the orginal design done by jon oxer.

I (austins_creations) got excited about a cm4 design. so put together this schematic
that should be all the needed elements to make the cm4 wifi IOT AP project work.
added the DIY POE switcher
added the ability for the cm4 to know which power mode is in use

pcb veiw is left mostly blank for jon to do routing on stream (if he so chooses to use the files)
but pcb veiw does have the elements from the last design copies over and converted for kicad use to ensure DRC passes
